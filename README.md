Flutter Mobile App

Overview

This mobile app was developed during my internship to facilitate communication between school administrators, parents, and students. The app enables admins to send real-time updates and notifications about:

Attendance: Notify parents about their childâ€™s attendance.

Announcements: Broadcast important announcements to all users.

The backend is built with NodeJs and the frontend for web is developed using React. The mobile app is powered by Flutter, utilizing Dart for a cross-platform solution.
