# Flutter Mobile App

## Overview
This mobile app was developed during my internship to facilitate communication between school administrators, parents, and students. The app enables admins to send real-time updates and notifications about:
- **Attendance**: Notify parents about their childâ€™s attendance.
- **Announcements**: Broadcast important announcements to all users.

The backend is built with **Express.js** and the frontend for web is developed using **React**. The mobile app is powered by **Flutter**, utilizing **Dart** for a cross-platform solution.
